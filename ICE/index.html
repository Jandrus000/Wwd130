    <ol>
        <li>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ</li>
        <li>Repentance</li>
        <li>Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins</li>
        <li>Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Because of the Savior's Atonement, His gospel provides an invitation to keep changing, growing, and becoming more pure.</p>
